# TritonHacks 2024 Unity GameDev Starter Kit
Welcome to the GameDev Kit! We offer you as much tools as possible here to learn how to and effectively build a **Nature-Themed** game using the Unity game development engine. 

You can start setting up your project by forking this repository and then learning how to get Unity up and running by checking out the GUIDE.md file. The guide has multiple sections with varying levels of importance depending on your experience, so make sure to gauge what you need to read before you get started so that you can use your time as efficiently as possible. 

If you get stuck at any point, ask your mentors and/or tutors for clarification, or for an in-depth elaboration on whats going on. We wish you the best of luck!
